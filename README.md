# 1984-book-vs-1984-album---NLP-Project
Inspired by the cultural phenomenon, Versus, in this project I'm going to be leveraging the NLP to compare 1984, the dystopian social science fiction novel by the English novelist George Orwell and 1984, the sixth studio album by American rock band Van Halen. In this project, I have explored the NLP techniques of: 1. summarizing text 2. sentiment analysis 3. word clouds.
